Bitcoin appreciated tremendously during the last few months of 2015, but the trend is beginning to shift. The 4-hour chart is clearly showing that the market started to print lower-highs, and also lower-lows, towards the end of December. The trading channel is now starting to curve lower and this kind of price action is very suggestive of an impending bear market.
For speculators, the $433 price level has become a major battle zone. This pivot has acted as support/resistance several times during the second half of December. If price breaks above $433 and trades near the $440 level for some time; $433 will most likely turn into support again.
A failure to break above $433 will most likely result in another plunge towards the big pivot area between $405-$406. This price level was respected on multiple occasions last month, so it is of great technical significance. And sell-off will most likely stall near this range.

The crypto market behaviour is very emotional. People tend to get greedy when the market is rising which results in FOMO (Fear of missing out). Also, people often sell their coins in irrational reaction of seeing red numbers. With our Fear and Greed Index, we try to save you from your own emotional overreactions. There are two simple assumptions:
Therefore, we analyze the current sentiment of the Bitcoin market and crunch the numbers into a simple meter from 0 to 100. Zero means "Extreme Fear", while 100 means "Extreme Greed". See below for further information on our data sources.
We are gathering data from the five following sources. Each data point is valued the same as the day before in order to visualize a meaningful progress in sentiment change of the crypto market.
First of all, the current index is for bitcoin only (we offer separate indices for large alt coins soon), because a big part of it is the volatility of the coin price.
But let’s list all the different factors we’re including in the current index:
We’re measuring the current volatility and max. drawdowns of bitcoin and compare it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 days and 90 days. We argue that an unusual rise in volatility is a sign of a fearful market.
Also, we’re measuring the current volume and market momentum (again in comparison with the last 30/90 day average values) and put those two values together. Generally, when we see high buying volumes in a positive market on a daily basis, we conclude that the market acts overly greedy / too bullish.
While our reddit sentiment analysis is still not in the live index (we’re still experimenting some market-related key words in the text processing algorithm), our twitter analysis is running. There, we gather and count posts on various hashtags for each coin (publicly, we show only those for Bitcoin) and check how fast and how many interactions they receive in certain time frames). A unusual high interaction rate results in a grown public interest in the coin and in our eyes, corresponds to a greedy market behaviour.
Together with strawpoll.com, quite a large public polling platform, we’re conducting weekly crypto polls and ask people how they see the market (disclaimer: we own this site, too). Usually, we’re seeing 2,000 - 3,000 votes on each poll, so we do get a picture of the sentiment of a group of crypto investors. We don’t give those results too much attention, but it was quite useful in the beginning of our studies. You can see some recent results here.
The dominance of a coin resembles the market cap share of the whole crypto market. Especially for Bitcoin, we think that a rise in Bitcoin dominance is caused by a fear of (and thus a reduction of) too speculative alt-coin investments, since Bitcoin is becoming more and more the safe haven of crypto. On the other side, when Bitcoin dominance shrinks, people are getting more greedy by investing in more risky alt-coins, dreaming of their chance in next big bull r... [TRUNCADO]

The RSI is a momentum oscillator that's widely used in technical analysis of stocks and commodities to identify changes in momentum and price direction.
The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to detect overbought or oversold conditions in the price of that security. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph) on a scale of 0 to 100.
Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition. In addition to identifying overbought and oversold securities, the RSI can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price.
The indicator was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal 1978 book, "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems." The RSI is one of the most popular technical indicators, and it's generally available on most trading platforms offered by online stock brokers.
As a momentum indicator, the relative strength index (RSI) compares a security's strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices go down. Relating the result of this comparison to price action can give traders an idea of how a security may perform. The RSI, especially when used in conjunction with other technical indicators, can help traders make better-informed trading decisions.
The RSI uses a two-part calculation that starts with the following formula:
R

RSI_{\text{step one}} = 100- \left[ \frac{100}{ 1 + \frac{\text{Average gain}}{\text{Average loss} }} \right]


RSIstep one​=100−[1+Average lossAverage gain​100​]
The average gain or loss used in this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during a look-back period. The formula uses a positive value for the average loss. Periods with price losses are counted as zero in the calculations of average gain. Periods with price increases are counted as zero in the calculations of average loss.
The standard number of periods used to calculate the initial RSI value is 14. For example, imagine the market closed higher seven out of the past 14 days with an initial average gain of 1%. The remaining seven days all closed lower with an initial average loss of −0.8%.
The first calculation for the RSI would look like the following expanded calculation:
55.55

55.55=100−​1+(140.8%​)(141%​)​100​​
Once there are 14 periods of data available, the second calculation can be done. Its purpose is to smooth the results so that the RSI only nears 100 or zero in a strongly trending market.

Fibonacci retracement levels are used by traders to help them find key price levels and zones where a security might stall, reverse, or continue moving within a trend. They are based on the Fibonacci sequence.
Fibonacci retracement levels are among the go-to tools for traders looking to identify potential support and resistance zones during pullbacks. The technical indicator is often found on leading online brokerage and trading platforms and is rooted in the Fibonacci sequence. These levels help traders spot key price areas where securities might pause, reverse, or continue trending. We take you through what you need to know below.
Fibonacci retracement levels are used to find potential support and resistance areas by measuring how much a security's price pulls back before continuing in its trend. Key levels like 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% are widely used because they align with market psychology, support and resistance zones, and technical indicators like moving averages.
The Fibonacci sequence has its roots enshrined in ancient mathematics, initially appearing in Indian and Arabic traditions before being introduced to Western Europe by Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci) in the 13th century. His book, Liber Abaci, popularized the sequence and helped replace Roman numerals with the more efficient Hindu-Arabic number system.
Beyond mathematics, Fibonacci's work has influenced fields like science, nature, architecture, and finance, especially because of its connection to the golden ratio, which appears in everything from plant growth to technical analysis.
To apply the retracement levels, traders need to identify the market trend. Is the security or market in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows, or conversely in a downtrend, with lower highs and lower lows?
Once the trend is identified, traders should choose the swing high and swing low as reference points. Most trading platforms have Fibonacci retracement tools that automatically generate key levels such as 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. These levels act as potential support in uptrends and resistance in downtrends, helping traders anticipate price reactions.
Shallow retracements, such as the 38.2% retracement, suggest strong momentum, while deeper retracements, like the 78.6% retracement, may indicate potential trend reversals in volatile markets.
The golden ratio, known as the divine proportion, can be found in various spaces, from geometry to human DNA.
In trading, the Fibonacci retracement levels are used to pick out entry points, especially if not wholly for price pullbacks in a trending market. The 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% levels are the most commonly watched zones for potential reversals.
In an uptrend, traders look for price pullbacks as well as bullish confirmation, such as candlestick patterns or relative strength index indicators, for oversold conditions and enter long positions. In a downtrend, traders wait for a throwback (opposite of a pullback) toward a Fibonacci resistance level and co... [TRUNCADO]

When we look back in a not-so-distant future, I believe we’ll remember 2025 as one of the most consequential years in the history of crypto. The sheer number and magnitude of de-risking events this year have been truly unprecedented. From the passage of the historic GENIUS Act—arguably the most important piece of financial legislation since Dodd-Frank—to the definitive end of Chokepoint 2.0, this year has marked a decisive turning point.
Over the last two decades, fintech has changed how people access financial products, but not how money actually moves. Innovation focused on cleaner interfaces, smoother onboarding, and better distribution, while the core financial infrastructure remained largely unchanged. For most of this period, the stack was being resold, but not rebuilt.
Today, we’re proud to announce that our liquid fund invested in ENA, the native token for Ethena Protocol, the issuer of USDe, the leading synthetic dollar. 

In our blogpost, The Endgame for Stablecoins, we stated how stablecoins are the largest addressable markets in crypto and how yield is the final frontier. While we were directionally right on yield-bearing stablecoins, we underestimated the market size for synthetic dollars.
At the risk of being overly succinct, there are broadly two types of assets: 1) Cash Flow Assets — primarily equities and bonds. These assets generate cash flows that investors assign value to. 2) Supply & Demand Assets — mostly applies to commodities and forex. Prices fluctuate based on supply and demand. Recently, crypto has instigated a new type of asset—one valued on attention. Today, “Attention Assets” are primarily user-generated assets (UGAs), like NFTs, creator coins, and memecoins.
Today, DoubleZero (DZ) launched onto mainnet-beta. Multicoin Capital co-led a $28M investment round in DoubleZero earlier this year.

Blockchains are globally distributed systems. The core L1 teams have collectively invested $1B+ over the last decade optimizing networking protocols, consensus, execution, and storage.
Today I’m excited to announce that Multicoin Capital, Jump Crypto (the largest trading firm in crypto), and Galaxy (the largest financial conglomerate in crypto) have successfully led a $1.65B PIPE into Forward Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: FORD), which will use the net proceeds to initiate a Solana treasury company strategy. Each sponsor committed over $100M in USD.
Today, we are thrilled to welcome Brian Strugats to Multicoin Capital as our new Head Trader. Brian will be responsible for providing best execution for the fund, managing our counterparty relationships, providing actionable market context to the investment team, and enhancing our trading capabilities.
It is effectively impossible for a regular person to create a new tradeable asset on traditional financial rails. Crypto trivializes this. Today, anyone in the world can create new assets on Solana in a few seconds for ~$0 cost.

Home » Crypto & Blockchain » Crypto Alert – Alt Season 2025 Is Here
Crypto alt season 2025 officially started on November 9th, 2024.
Three indicators confirm crypto alt season 2025 started on November 9th: crypto total market cap excl. BTC and ETH breaks out, Dogecoin clears its 50% Fibonacci level, the USD remains below 107 points.
In this article, we review 3 out of the 4 indicators that are screaming ALT SEASON 2025 is here.
Interestingly, the 4th indicator is testing a breakout, so it might be a matter of hours or days until all alt season 2025 confirmations are in!
First alt season indicator – total crypto market cap excl. leading indicators BTC/ETH.
This indicator matters simply because it excludes Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). That’s because the two largest cryptocurrencies are great leading indicators, but tend to move slower when alts accelerate their move (typically at the start of alt season).
As seen below, we accurately predicted the start of alt season 2024 late January 2024, see chart below.
This crypto market breakout has legs. The first two targets are shown on the chart. That’s quite some upside potential before alt season 2025 gets back to its 2021 highs (where the breakout process to ATH will start).
The second indicator is Dogecoin (DOGE), the ultimate alt season barometer. It is now above its most important Fibonacci level, since Nov 9th, 2024, confirming alt season 2025.
We have been repeating the importance of the 50% Fibonacci level throughout all our writings since many years.
Dogecoin is clearing, convincingly, its 50% Fibonacci level, around Nov 9th, 2024.
The message is loud and clear – Dogecoin, the ultimate bullish momentum barometer among all altcoins, is starting a new bullish wave. This is the most convincing alt season 2025 signal.
The third indicator is an external one – the US Dollar, inversely correlated to crypto markets, is unable to clear its 50% Fibonacci level (so far, at least) – this raises confidence in the alt season indicators outlined above.
The US Dollar is inversely correlated to Bitcoin and altcoins.
The USD chart makes it clear – it may have bounced in October, but the bounce happened from oversold levels.
Once the USD clears 107 points, it will turn bullish. Given this current chart setup, it seems a rather low probability for the USD to turn bullish. Until the USD turns bullish, crypto can move much higher.
The 4th (and last) indicator confirming a new alt season is Shiba, the 2nd largest meme, which ideally also confirms a breakout.
Arguably, its chart suggests that it’s a matter of time, either hours or days, until SHIB clears THE most important Fibonacci level which is $.00002345.
If and when SHIB moves above this level, it will be the final indicator confirming the new bullish trend in alts.
This new alt season has legs, and will not peak before June 2025 is our thesis.
Premium crypto members were alerted ahead of the breakout – most of our token tips alts have risen between 30 to 200... [TRUNCADO]

The price band between $352-$353 has seen quite a bit of action this month. In my previous Bitcoin technical analysis article from the 13th, I explained why this area is of great technical significance and why it is crucial for the market to surmount this area in the future. When the market encountered the $353 pivot for a third time on the 26th, it briefly traded above it for a few hours, but then quickly dropped back under $353.
Although there wasn’t enough buying momentum to really smash though this major pivot zone, price has slowly made its way above $353 over the last two days. This can be observed very clearly on the 1-hour chart, which shows that the market has now used $353 as support on three occasions in the past 24h. If price makes it back under $353 again, I think it is very likely that this level will turn into resistance, and price will most likely head south.

Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator that helps investors identify price trends, measure trend momentum, and identify entry points for buying or selling a security. Gerald Appel developed the MACD indicator in the 1970s, and it is still one of the most popular technical tools today. It is readily available on most trading platforms offered by top online stock brokers.
The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The calculation creates the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called the signal line, plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals.
Traders may buy the security when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and sell—or short—the security when the MACD line crosses below the signal line. MACD indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.
MACD
=
12-Period EMA 
−
 26-Period EMA


\text{MACD}=\text{12-Period EMA }-\text{ 26-Period EMA}


MACD=12-Period EMA − 26-Period EMA
MACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (26 periods) from the short-term EMA (12 periods). An EMA is a moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.
The exponential moving average is an exponentially weighted moving average. An exponentially weighted moving average tends to have more significant reactions to recent price changes than a simple moving average (SMA).
MACD has a positive value (shown as the blue line on the MACD chart) whenever the 12-period EMA (indicated by the red line on the price chart) is above the 26-period EMA (the blue line in the price chart), and a negative value when the 12-period EMA is below the 26-period EMA. The distance between MACD and its baseline depends on the distance between the two EMAs.
As shown in the chart below, rises and drops in MACD (blue) values correspond to the movements of the two EMA lines.
MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the next chart below) that graphs the distance between MACD and its signal line. If MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline or zero line. If MACD is below its signal line, the histogram will be below the MACD’s baseline. Traders use the MACD’s histogram to identify peaks of bullish or bearish momentum, and to generate overbought/oversold trade signals.
The relative strength index (RSI) signals whether an instrument is overbought or oversold based on its recent price action. The RSI is an oscillator that calculates the average price gains and losses over a given period. The default is 14 periods with values bounded from 0 to 100. A reading above 70 suggests an overbought condition, while a reading below 30 is considered oversold, with both potentially signaling that a top or a bottom is forming.
Unlike the RSI or other oscillator studies, the MACD lines do n... [TRUNCADO]

Market Indicators Suggest Altcoin Season Could Be Near—Here’s Why
The cryptocurrency market is showing potential signs of an impending altcoin season. Market watchers cite a confluence of technical, sentiment, and macroeconomic factors that could lead to a significant rally in altcoins.
The outlook follows a notable downturn in the altcoin market, which has dropped about 37.6% since its high in early December 2024. As of the latest data, the market cap stands at $1.1 trillion.
From a technical perspective, Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance, which measures Bitcoin’s market share relative to the total cryptocurrency market, seems to be at a key turning point.
A recent chart shared by crypto analyst Mister Crypto on X highlighted that Bitcoin Dominance has reached a resistance following a rising wedge pattern. This pattern is generally seen as a bearish signal, often leading to sharp pullbacks.
“Bitcoin Dominance will collapse. Altseason will come. We will all get rich this year!” he wrote.
In addition, another analyst corroborated these findings, noting that Bitcoin Dominance has reached a peak. Thus, he forecasted a subsequent downturn.
However, the Altcoin Season Index has dropped to a low of 16. The index, which analyzes the performance of the top 50 altcoins against Bitcoin, indicated that altcoins are currently underperforming.
Notably, this level mirrors the bottom for altcoins observed around August 2024. This period preceded a significant altcoin rally, and the index peaked at 88 by December 2024.
Lastly, from a macroeconomic perspective, the 90-day delay in President Donald Trump’s tariff implementation has renewed market confidence. This delay is perceived as a positive signal, potentially encouraging capital inflows into altcoins.
“90 days tariff pause = 90 days of altseason,” an analyst claimed.
Moreover, analyst Crypto Rover pointed to quantitative easing (QE) as a catalyst for an altseason. According to him, when the central bank starts pumping money into the economy (through QE), altcoins could experience a significant price surge, benefiting from the increased liquidity and investor optimism.
“Once QE starts. Altcoin season will make a massive comeback!” he stated.
However, in the latest report, Kaiko Research stressed that a traditional altcoin season may no longer be feasible. Instead, any potential rally could be selective, with only a few altcoins experiencing significant upside. The focus will likely be on assets with real-world use cases, strong liquidity, and revenue-generating potential.
“Altseasons may become a thing of the past, necessitating a more nuanced categorization beyond just ‘altcoins,’ as correlations in returns, growth factors, and liquidity among crypto assets are diverging significantly over time,” the report read.
Kaiko Research noted that the growing concentration of liquidity in a few altcoins and Bitcoin may disrupt the typical capital flow into altcoins during market upswings. Furthermore, as Bitcoin becomes more w... [TRUNCADO]

There's a widespread belief in the cyclical nature of the crypto market. According to this concept, cryptoasset dynamics often follow a recognizable pattern: Bitcoin leads, then Ethereum gains attention, and finally altcoins rise. During these periods, many high-return opportunities emerge, leaving newcomers feeling they’ve missed out.
A trader's main challenge is identifying the period of the most active altcoin growth, commonly known as altseason. However, each cycle unfolds differently and is influenced by unique market events, complicating forecasting and analysis.
Coinpaper's editorial team explored what drives altcoin growth, which metrics indicate the approach of altseason, and how to use market data for informed decisions.
Altcoins are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. This category includes widely known assets like Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL), as well as smaller projects such as Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Aave (AAVE). Analysts classify altcoins based on their use cases or functionality, though no universally accepted standard exists.
The primary difference between Bitcoin and altcoins lies in market positioning and price behavior. Bitcoin, due to its high market capitalization, is considered a "base" asset or digital gold, while altcoins tend to be more volatile and are influenced by trends, speculation, and overall market sentiment.
Based on these distinctions, the crypto community has observed a sequence of capital flow through four phases:
Although technically altseason begins in the second phase, the community typically associates it with the fourth, when a broad range of assets outperforms Bitcoin and Ethereum. This period is characterized by growing retail interest, heightened media activity, new project launches, and expanding market capitalization of lesser-known tokens.
While the concept of cyclical capital flows underpins altseason theory, some analysts question its reliability. Arthur Hayes, for example, argues that four-year cycles no longer hold, while Bernstein suggests a possible extension of the bullish phase.
Other factors, such as institutional activity and macroeconomic conditions, are also reshaping traditional market dynamics. With over 100,000 altcoins and 400+ asset categories tracked by CoinGecko, establishing a unified classification system remains challenging.
The Altseason Index tracks how many of the top 50 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. If over 75% of these assets grow faster than Bitcoin, the market is considered to be in altseason.
As of September 2025, the index stands at 76 points, signaling broad altcoin outperformance. CoinGlass and CoinMarketCap offer similar versions, with minor differences due to calculation methods.
Historical charts of the Altseason Index reveal how capital flows between Bitcoin and altcoins over time. In September 2025, the index reached 80 points, marking the altseason zone. The gradual rise in 2025 contrasts with the sharp, short-lived ... [TRUNCADO]

Decoding Altcoin Season: Key Indicators and Timing Your Entry and Exit Points
Altcoin Season—a period characterized by high volatility and astronomical returns where cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (BTC) dramatically outperform the market leader—is the most anticipated event in the crypto world. Successfully Decoding Altcoin Season: Key Indicators and Timing Your Entry and Exit Points is crucial for maximizing profit while minimizing exposure to the inevitable sharp retracements. This intense phase, often lasting several weeks to a few months, is not a random event but a predictable cycle driven by capital flow, market psychology, and measurable quantitative metrics. Understanding the rhythm of this cycle is essential for any serious investor looking to capitalize on the next major wave, as detailed further in our comprehensive guide, Navigating the Altcoin Market: Investment Strategies, Altcoin Season Cycles, and Top Crypto Picks for 2025.
Altcoin Season is not a switch that flips overnight; it is the culmination of a multi-stage process that typically follows Bitcoin’s strong rally phase. Capital generally flows through the crypto ecosystem in a predictable manner:
Successful timing relies on analyzing specific, quantifiable metrics that track capital flow and market health. These indicators act as leading signals for entry and exit.
Bitcoin Dominance is arguably the single most critical metric. It represents the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization to the total cryptocurrency market capitalization.
The Total Altcoin Market Cap (often charted as TOTAL2, which excludes BTC) provides a clearer picture of the sheer volume of capital flowing into the alternative sector.
The true measure of Altcoin Season is the performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin.
Timing the exact start of Altcoin Season is impossible, but strategic investors position themselves during the optimal accumulation window—the period of low conviction and high fear preceding the dominance shift.
Rather than trying to catch the first green candle, employ a staged accumulation strategy:
Sector Rotation Insight: Entry timing can be further refined by watching sector rotation. Early Alt Seasons often favor foundational layers (L1s, scaling solutions, infrastructure). As the season matures, capital flows into riskier, narrative-driven sectors like meme coins, Gaming/Metaverse, or new AI applications (The Rise of AI and DeFi Altcoins: Sector-Specific Investment Opportunities and Risks).
The failure to execute a disciplined exit strategy is the number one reason investors lose profits during the volatile Altcoin Season. The peak is marked by extreme euphoria and irrational price action.
The final stage requires investors to ignore FOMO and focus purely on exit signals:
Instead of selling everything at one target, use a staggered, quantitative approach:
This strategy ensures you capture profits along the way and prevents the entire portfolio from collapsing during the inevitable ... [TRUNCADO]

Altcoin Season Predictions and Analysis 2025: Complete Market Cycle Guide
Altcoin seasons represent periods of significant outperformance by alternative cryptocurrencies relative to Bitcoin, creating substantial opportunities and risks for investors. This comprehensive analysis explores the mechanics of altcoin cycles, current market conditions, and strategic approaches for navigating the dynamic altcoin landscape in 2025.
An altcoin season occurs when alternative cryptocurrencies significantly outperform Bitcoin over a sustained period, typically characterized by:
Bitcoin rallies establish crypto legitimacy, institutional interest validates the space, early adopters rotate profits into altcoins, smart money begins accumulation
Media coverage increases awareness, retail investors enter seeking higher returns, FOMO drives indiscriminate buying, new projects launch to capture attention
Extreme speculation and valuations, quality projects mixed with obvious scams, maximum retail participation, influencer promotion reaches peak
Reality sets in regarding valuations, weak projects collapse rapidly, flight to quality (Bitcoin, major altcoins), market sentiment turns negative
Professional market makers now provide liquidity for altcoins:
For comprehensive altcoin season tracking and analysis tools, [CoinCryptoRank](/altcoin-season) provides real-time sector rotation monitoring, Bitcoin dominance analysis, and emerging opportunity identification.
Explore our altcoin season tracker and market analysis tools to stay ahead of market cycles.
The optimal time is during Bitcoin dominance peaks (>60%) when altcoins are undervalued relative to Bitcoin. Start with quality, large-cap altcoins and gradually add smaller positions as the altcoin season develops. Avoid buying during peak euphoria when dominance is <40%.
Focus on projects with strong fundamentals: active development, real utility, growing user base, and clear value propositions. Look for sectors with emerging narratives (AI, RWA, gaming) and projects solving actual problems. Avoid projects that are purely speculative or have unclear use cases.
Conservative investors should limit altcoins to 10-30% of crypto allocation, with the remainder in Bitcoin and Ethereum. More aggressive investors might allocate 30-60% to altcoins, but never more than you can afford to lose. Consider your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and overall financial situation.
Warning signs include Bitcoin dominance falling below 35%, obvious scam projects succeeding, mainstream media euphoria, and extreme price predictions becoming common. Technical indicators like RSI above 80 on major altcoins and parabolic price moves also suggest cycle peaks.
Most altcoins lose 80-95% of their value in bear markets. Only hold high-conviction, fundamentally strong projects through downturns. Consider taking profits during bull markets and reallocating to Bitcoin/stablecoins for bear market preservation, then reaccumulate quality altcoins at lowe... [TRUNCADO]

Devconnect Buenos Aires wrapped up as the largest Ethereum Foundation event yet, bringing together a global mix of developers, founders, creators, and curious newcomers.
Q3 2025 brought an exciting wave of innovation and community energy! Explore the projects we funded this quarter and the work they’re advancing:
Disclaimer: The following blog is a proposal from the Account Abstraction team. Content may not imply consensus views, and the EF is a broad organization that includes a healthy diversity of opinion across Protocol and beyond that together strengthen Ethereum.

Since the early days of Ethereum, the promise has always been bold: a global, permissionless, censorship-resistant computing platform. Today, that promise is more alive than ever. Ethereum has scaled through rollups, where blockspace is abundant and transactions are cheap. The challenge now is not just throughput, but seamless user experience across that multichain horizon.

What if all the L2s felt like a single, unified Ethereum?

No bridges to think about, no chain names to recognize, no fragmented balances or assets.

That’s the vision of the **Ethereum Interop
Ethereum’s weekly All Core Developer calls are a lot to keep up with, so this "Checkpoint" series aims for high-level updates roughly every 4-6 weeks, depending on what’s happening in core development. See the previous update here.



If you enjoy reading core development updates, you may also be keen to learn that Forkcast now publishes call summaries, chats and transcripts for each All Core Devs call, usually available within a couple hours of the call.
Fusaka follows this year's Pectra upgrade, representing a major step forward in Ethereum's scaling roadmap that improves L1 performance, increases blob throughput, and enhances user experience.

The Fusaka network upgrade is scheduled to activate on the Ethereum mainnet at slot 13,164,544 (December 3, 2025, 21:49:11 UTC). Fusaka also introduces Blob Parameter Only (BPO) forks to safely scale blob throughput after PeerDAS activation. These are minimal, config-only upgrades that adjust the blob target/max and fee update fraction. See the activation table below for further details.

The Fusaka mainnet client releases are listed below.
In two weeks, we open the doors to the first-ever Ethereum World’s Fair at La Rural in Buenos Aires.

This year isn’t about someday. It’s about now. On Ethereum today you can pay, play, vote, save, borrow, lend, and chat, all onchain — and at Devconnect you’ll experience that shift hands-on, IRL.
Buenos Aires is the right backdrop for this moment: a city where crypto is part of daily life and where builders are ready to show what’s live.

Below is your guide to what’s inside the fairgrounds, how to plan your week, and what to do before you arrive.
Over the past few years, the Ethereum ecosystem has grown in depth, diversity, and maturity. Builders and communities worldwide have pushed the boundaries of what’s possible, creating new tools, pr... [TRUNCADO]

Bitcoin liquidity grabs continued at the Wall Street open, with traders hoping that a breakthrough of resistance would propel the BTC price toward the $100,000 zone.
Ether price wobbled as weak onchain activity, low futures demand and aggressive selling by holders favored a potential ETH price drop to $2,300.
According to Delphi Digital, Crypto exchanges are racing to become the home screen for trading, payments and Web3.
Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation.

>>> FUENTE: https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-technical-analysis-for-11282015-big-battle-at-353/
The price band between $352-$353 has seen quite a bit of action this month. In my previous Bitcoin technical analysis article from the 13th, I explained why this area is of great technical significance and why it is crucial for the market to surmount this area in the future. When the market encountered the $353 pivot for a third time on the 26th, it briefly traded above it for a few hours, but then quickly dropped back under $353.
Although there wasn’t enough buying momentum to really smash though this major pivot zone, price has slowly made its way above $353 over the last two days. This can be observed very clearly on the 1-hour chart, which shows that the market has now used $353 as support on three occasions in the past 24h. If price makes it back under $353 again, I think it is very likely that this level will turn into resistance, and price will most likely head south.

When we look back in a not-so-distant future, I believe we’ll remember 2025 as one of the most consequential years in the history of crypto. The sheer number and magnitude of de-risking events this year have been truly unprecedented. From the passage of the historic GENIUS Act—arguably the most important piece of financial legislation since Dodd-Frank—to the definitive end of Chokepoint 2.0, this year has marked a decisive turning point.
Over the last two decades, fintech has changed how people access financial products, but not how money actually moves. Innovation focused on cleaner interfaces, smoother onboarding, and better distribution, while the core financial infrastructure remained largely unchanged. For most of this period, the stack was being resold, but not rebuilt.
Today, we’re proud to announce that our liquid fund invested in ENA, the native token for Ethena Protocol, the issuer of USDe, the leading synthetic dollar. 

In our blogpost, The Endgame for Stablecoins, we stated how stablecoins are the largest addressable markets in crypto and how yield is the final frontier. While we were directionally right on yield-bearing stablecoins, we underestimated the market size for synthetic dollars.
At the risk of being overly succinct, there are broadly two types of assets: 1) Cash Flow Assets — primarily equities and bonds. These assets generate cash flows that investors assign value to. 2) Supply & Demand Assets — mostly applies to commodities and forex. Prices fluctuate based on supply and demand. Recently, crypto has instigated a new type of asset—one valued on attention. Today, “Attention Assets” are primarily user-generated assets (UGAs), like NFTs, creator coins, and memecoins.
Today, DoubleZero (DZ) launched onto mainnet-beta. Multicoin Capital co-led a $28M investment round in DoubleZero earlier this year.

Blockchains are globally distributed systems. The core L1 teams have collectively invested $1B+ over the last decade optimizing networking protocols, consensus, execution, and storage.
Today I’m excited to announce that Multicoin Capital, Jump Crypto (the largest trading firm in crypto), and Galaxy (the largest financial conglomerate in crypto) have successfully led a $1.65B PIPE into Forward Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: FORD), which will use the net proceeds to initiate a Solana treasury company strategy. Each sponsor committed over $100M in USD.
Today, we are thrilled to welcome Brian Strugats to Multicoin Capital as our new Head Trader. Brian will be responsible for providing best execution for the fund, managing our counterparty relationships, providing actionable market context to the investment team, and enhancing our trading capabilities.
It is effectively impossible for a regular person to create a new tradeable asset on traditional financial rails. Crypto trivializes this. Today, anyone in the world can create new assets on Solana in a few seconds for ~$0 cost.

Consequently, there has been an explosion in user-generated ass... [TRUNCADO]

The RSI is a momentum oscillator that's widely used in technical analysis of stocks and commodities to identify changes in momentum and price direction.
The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to detect overbought or oversold conditions in the price of that security. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph) on a scale of 0 to 100.
Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition. In addition to identifying overbought and oversold securities, the RSI can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price.
The indicator was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal 1978 book, "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems." The RSI is one of the most popular technical indicators, and it's generally available on most trading platforms offered by online stock brokers.
As a momentum indicator, the relative strength index (RSI) compares a security's strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices go down. Relating the result of this comparison to price action can give traders an idea of how a security may perform. The RSI, especially when used in conjunction with other technical indicators, can help traders make better-informed trading decisions.
The RSI uses a two-part calculation that starts with the following formula:
R
S

I
step one

=
100
−

[

100

1

Average gain
Average loss

RSI_{\text{step one}} = 100- \left[ \frac{100}{ 1 + \frac{\text{Average gain}}{\text{Average loss} }} \right]


RSIstep one​=100−[1+Average lossAverage gain​100​]
The average gain or loss used in this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during a look-back period. The formula uses a positive value for the average loss. Periods with price losses are counted as zero in the calculations of average gain. Periods with price increases are counted as zero in the calculations of average loss.
The standard number of periods used to calculate the initial RSI value is 14. For example, imagine the market closed higher seven out of the past 14 days with an initial average gain of 1%. The remaining seven days all closed lower with an initial average loss of −0.8%.
The first calculation for the RSI would look like the following expanded calculation:
55.55

55.55=100−​1+(140.8%​)(141%​)​100​​
Once there are 14 periods of data available, the second calculation can be done. Its purpose is to smooth the results so that the RSI only nears 100 or zero in a strongly trending market.

Home » Crypto & Blockchain » Crypto Alert – Alt Season 2025 Is Here
Crypto alt season 2025 officially started on November 9th, 2024.
Three indicators confirm crypto alt season 2025 started on November 9th: crypto total market cap excl. BTC and ETH breaks out, Dogecoin clears its 50% Fibonacci level, the USD remains below 107 points.
In this article, we review 3 out of the 4 indicators that are screaming ALT SEASON 2025 is here.
Interestingly, the 4th indicator is testing a breakout, so it might be a matter of hours or days until all alt season 2025 confirmations are in!
First alt season indicator – total crypto market cap excl. leading indicators BTC/ETH.
This indicator matters simply because it excludes Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). That’s because the two largest cryptocurrencies are great leading indicators, but tend to move slower when alts accelerate their move (typically at the start of alt season).
As seen below, we accurately predicted the start of alt season 2024 late January 2024, see chart below.
This crypto market breakout has legs. The first two targets are shown on the chart. That’s quite some upside potential before alt season 2025 gets back to its 2021 highs (where the breakout process to ATH will start).
The second indicator is Dogecoin (DOGE), the ultimate alt season barometer. It is now above its most important Fibonacci level, since Nov 9th, 2024, confirming alt season 2025.
We have been repeating the importance of the 50% Fibonacci level throughout all our writings since many years.
Dogecoin is clearing, convincingly, its 50% Fibonacci level, around Nov 9th, 2024.
The message is loud and clear – Dogecoin, the ultimate bullish momentum barometer among all altcoins, is starting a new bullish wave. This is the most convincing alt season 2025 signal.
The third indicator is an external one – the US Dollar, inversely correlated to crypto markets, is unable to clear its 50% Fibonacci level (so far, at least) – this raises confidence in the alt season indicators outlined above.
The US Dollar is inversely correlated to Bitcoin and altcoins.
The USD chart makes it clear – it may have bounced in October, but the bounce happened from oversold levels.
Once the USD clears 107 points, it will turn bullish. Given this current chart setup, it seems a rather low probability for the USD to turn bullish. Until the USD turns bullish, crypto can move much higher.
The 4th (and last) indicator confirming a new alt season is Shiba, the 2nd largest meme, which ideally also confirms a breakout.
Arguably, its chart suggests that it’s a matter of time, either hours or days, until SHIB clears THE most important Fibonacci level which is $.00002345.
If and when SHIB moves above this level, it will be the final indicator confirming the new bullish trend in alts.
This new alt season has legs, and will not peak before June 2025 is our thesis.
Premium crypto members were alerted ahead of the breakout – most of our token tips alts have risen between 30 to 200... [TRUNCADO]

Altcoin Season Timing: Analysts Map Key Triggers for 2025 Rally
Altcoin Season Timing: Analysts Map Key Triggers for 2025 Rally
Market analysts are tracking Bitcoin dominance and gold resistance levels as key indicators for the next altcoin season. Recent analysis suggests specific conditions must align before alternative cryptocurrencies begin their expected major rally.
Crypto analyst Stockmoney Lizards emphasizes that true altcoin season occurs only when Bitcoin dominance breaks below 60%. This metric currently trades within a defined channel, indicating the market remains in early to mid-phase of the bull run. Bitcoin continues to attract institutional capital before funds rotate into smaller cryptocurrencies.
Every couple of weeks the same narrative: "Altseason is here!" I've fallen for this myself and been proven wrong multiple times. That's the truth, posted moon charts here as well.
However, I know the time will come, the… https://t.co/aBmXnbYEdc pic.twitter.com/uf6YArwDcA
The analyst warns against premature altcoin buying based on hype. Instead, strategic accumulation should occur only at extreme oversold levels when the Relative Strength Index drops below 25-30 on 4-hour or daily timeframes. These conditions typically produce 50% to 200% rebounds in altcoin prices.
Analyst Michaël van de Poppe identifies gold’s performance near $3,365 resistance as a critical factor for altcoin direction. Gold’s failure to break this level could trigger capital rotation into risk assets including altcoins. A gold breakout above resistance might cause altcoin corrections as investors move to traditional safe havens.
It did test the resistance zone and failed to break through it.
Monitoring this chart in the upcoming week as we're facing a pivotal moment.
This correlation between gold and digital assets reflects broader market sentiment. When gold struggles at resistance, risk appetite often increases, benefiting alternative cryptocurrencies. The relationship demonstrates how traditional financial markets influence crypto pricing dynamics.
Analyst Ahmed, known as CryptoBheem, updates his altcoin market cap outlook following recent price action. The total altcoin market cap bottomed at $800 billion rather than his earlier $750 billion target. This revision reflects stronger support levels than initially expected.
It bottomed at $800B & I’ve been slightly off with the $750B bottom target.
From here wether $750-700B comes or not is dependent on dominance. It’s inside an area of extremely big levels of mean reversion.
Summing it up all together, from what I’ve been… https://t.co/wUpxM3Ngii pic.twitter.com/gytWYFwUHY
Bitcoin dominance currently sits within a mean reversion zone. This technical position suggests either further altcoin weakness or the start of a new upward cycle. The dominance metric tracks capital allocation between Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies.

The crypto market behaviour is very emotional. People tend to get greedy when the market is rising which results in FOMO (Fear of missing out). Also, people often sell their coins in irrational reaction of seeing red numbers. With our Fear and Greed Index, we try to save you from your own emotional overreactions. There are two simple assumptions:
Therefore, we analyze the current sentiment of the Bitcoin market and crunch the numbers into a simple meter from 0 to 100. Zero means "Extreme Fear", while 100 means "Extreme Greed". See below for further information on our data sources.
We are gathering data from the five following sources. Each data point is valued the same as the day before in order to visualize a meaningful progress in sentiment change of the crypto market.
First of all, the current index is for bitcoin only (we offer separate indices for large alt coins soon), because a big part of it is the volatility of the coin price.
But let’s list all the different factors we’re including in the current index:
We’re measuring the current volatility and max. drawdowns of bitcoin and compare it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 days and 90 days. We argue that an unusual rise in volatility is a sign of a fearful market.
Also, we’re measuring the current volume and market momentum (again in comparison with the last 30/90 day average values) and put those two values together. Generally, when we see high buying volumes in a positive market on a daily basis, we conclude that the market acts overly greedy / too bullish.
While our reddit sentiment analysis is still not in the live index (we’re still experimenting some market-related key words in the text processing algorithm), our twitter analysis is running. There, we gather and count posts on various hashtags for each coin (publicly, we show only those for Bitcoin) and check how fast and how many interactions they receive in certain time frames). A unusual high interaction rate results in a grown public interest in the coin and in our eyes, corresponds to a greedy market behaviour.
Together with strawpoll.com, quite a large public polling platform, we’re conducting weekly crypto polls and ask people how they see the market (disclaimer: we own this site, too). Usually, we’re seeing 2,000 - 3,000 votes on each poll, so we do get a picture of the sentiment of a group of crypto investors. We don’t give those results too much attention, but it was quite useful in the beginning of our studies. You can see some recent results here.
The dominance of a coin resembles the market cap share of the whole crypto market. Especially for Bitcoin, we think that a rise in Bitcoin dominance is caused by a fear of (and thus a reduction of) too speculative alt-coin investments, since Bitcoin is becoming more and more the safe haven of crypto. On the other side, when Bitcoin dominance shrinks, people are getting more greedy by investing in more risky alt-coins, dreaming of their chance in next big bull r... [TRUNCADO]

The crypto market moves in cycles, and altcoin season—when alternative cryptocurrencies significantly outperform Bitcoin—remains one of the most anticipated phases. As we move through 2025, investors and traders alike are wondering: when will the next altcoin season begin?
Bitcoin experiences strong price appreciation, attracting capital into the market.
Traders rotate profits into altcoins, triggering widespread rallies.
However, timing this cycle depends on multiple factors, including liquidity conditions, investor sentiment, and Bitcoin dominance.
One of the most reliable indicators for altcoin season is Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D)—the percentage of total crypto market capitalization held by Bitcoin. When BTC.D is high (above 50%), Bitcoin is leading the market. But when it starts declining sharply, capital often flows into altcoins.
As of early 2025, Bitcoin dominance remains relatively high, which suggests altcoin season has not yet begun. However, traders are watching for a breakdown below key support levels as a potential trigger.
The Role of interest rates and Quantitative Tightening for Altcoin season
Unlike previous bull cycles, 2025 presents a unique challenge: Quantitative Tightening (QT) and high interest rates. Central banks, including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have been withdrawing liquidity from the financial system by reducing their balance sheets and keeping interest rates elevated.
This is a stark contrast to the liquidity-driven rally of 2020–2021 when altcoins thrived in an environment of low interest rates and aggressive money printing. If tightening continues, speculative assets like altcoins could struggle to gain momentum.
However, if economic conditions force central banks to pivot towards a more accommodative stance (such as rate cuts or slowing QT), risk assets—including altcoins—could see a surge in demand.
Apart from macroeconomic trends, specific crypto-market triggers could signal the start of altcoin season in 2025:
Historically, Ethereum (ETH) has led the altcoin rally. A breakout in ETH/BTC would signal that capital is rotating from Bitcoin into altcoins, marking the start of altcoin season. Additionally, Ethereum’s continued improvements in scalability—such as Layer-2 adoption and the upcoming Pectra upgrade—could provide the infrastructure for a broader altcoin surge.

Fibonacci retracement levels are used by traders to help them find key price levels and zones where a security might stall, reverse, or continue moving within a trend. They are based on the Fibonacci sequence.
Fibonacci retracement levels are among the go-to tools for traders looking to identify potential support and resistance zones during pullbacks. The technical indicator is often found on leading online brokerage and trading platforms and is rooted in the Fibonacci sequence. These levels help traders spot key price areas where securities might pause, reverse, or continue trending. We take you through what you need to know below.
Fibonacci retracement levels are used to find potential support and resistance areas by measuring how much a security's price pulls back before continuing in its trend. Key levels like 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% are widely used because they align with market psychology, support and resistance zones, and technical indicators like moving averages.
The Fibonacci sequence has its roots enshrined in ancient mathematics, initially appearing in Indian and Arabic traditions before being introduced to Western Europe by Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci) in the 13th century. His book, Liber Abaci, popularized the sequence and helped replace Roman numerals with the more efficient Hindu-Arabic number system.
Beyond mathematics, Fibonacci's work has influenced fields like science, nature, architecture, and finance, especially because of its connection to the golden ratio, which appears in everything from plant growth to technical analysis.
To apply the retracement levels, traders need to identify the market trend. Is the security or market in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows, or conversely in a downtrend, with lower highs and lower lows?
Once the trend is identified, traders should choose the swing high and swing low as reference points. Most trading platforms have Fibonacci retracement tools that automatically generate key levels such as 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. These levels act as potential support in uptrends and resistance in downtrends, helping traders anticipate price reactions.
Shallow retracements, such as the 38.2% retracement, suggest strong momentum, while deeper retracements, like the 78.6% retracement, may indicate potential trend reversals in volatile markets.
The golden ratio, known as the divine proportion, can be found in various spaces, from geometry to human DNA.
In trading, the Fibonacci retracement levels are used to pick out entry points, especially if not wholly for price pullbacks in a trending market. The 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% levels are the most commonly watched zones for potential reversals.
In an uptrend, traders look for price pullbacks as well as bullish confirmation, such as candlestick patterns or relative strength index indicators, for oversold conditions and enter long positions. In a downtrend, traders wait for a throwback (opposite of a pullback) toward a Fibonacci resistance level and co... [TRUNCADO]

Devconnect Buenos Aires wrapped up as the largest Ethereum Foundation event yet, bringing together a global mix of developers, founders, creators, and curious newcomers.
Q3 2025 brought an exciting wave of innovation and community energy! Explore the projects we funded this quarter and the work they’re advancing:
Disclaimer: The following blog is a proposal from the Account Abstraction team. Content may not imply consensus views, and the EF is a broad organization that includes a healthy diversity of opinion across Protocol and beyond that together strengthen Ethereum.

Since the early days of Ethereum, the promise has always been bold: a global, permissionless, censorship-resistant computing platform. Today, that promise is more alive than ever. Ethereum has scaled through rollups, where blockspace is abundant and transactions are cheap. The challenge now is not just throughput, but seamless user experience across that multichain horizon.

What if all the L2s felt like a single, unified Ethereum?

No bridges to think about, no chain names to recognize, no fragmented balances or assets.

That’s the vision of the **Ethereum Interop
Ethereum’s weekly All Core Developer calls are a lot to keep up with, so this "Checkpoint" series aims for high-level updates roughly every 4-6 weeks, depending on what’s happening in core development. See the previous update here.



If you enjoy reading core development updates, you may also be keen to learn that Forkcast now publishes call summaries, chats and transcripts for each All Core Devs call, usually available within a couple hours of the call.
Fusaka follows this year's Pectra upgrade, representing a major step forward in Ethereum's scaling roadmap that improves L1 performance, increases blob throughput, and enhances user experience.

The Fusaka network upgrade is scheduled to activate on the Ethereum mainnet at slot 13,164,544 (December 3, 2025, 21:49:11 UTC). Fusaka also introduces Blob Parameter Only (BPO) forks to safely scale blob throughput after PeerDAS activation. These are minimal, config-only upgrades that adjust the blob target/max and fee update fraction. See the activation table below for further details.

The Fusaka mainnet client releases are listed below.
In two weeks, we open the doors to the first-ever Ethereum World’s Fair at La Rural in Buenos Aires.

This year isn’t about someday. It’s about now. On Ethereum today you can pay, play, vote, save, borrow, lend, and chat, all onchain — and at Devconnect you’ll experience that shift hands-on, IRL.
Buenos Aires is the right backdrop for this moment: a city where crypto is part of daily life and where builders are ready to show what’s live.

Below is your guide to what’s inside the fairgrounds, how to plan your week, and what to do before you arrive.
Over the past few years, the Ethereum ecosystem has grown in depth, diversity, and maturity. Builders and communities worldwide have pushed the boundaries of what’s possible, creating new tools, pr... [TRUNCADO]

Bitcoin appreciated tremendously during the last few months of 2015, but the trend is beginning to shift. The 4-hour chart is clearly showing that the market started to print lower-highs, and also lower-lows, towards the end of December. The trading channel is now starting to curve lower and this kind of price action is very suggestive of an impending bear market.
For speculators, the $433 price level has become a major battle zone. This pivot has acted as support/resistance several times during the second half of December. If price breaks above $433 and trades near the $440 level for some time; $433 will most likely turn into support again.
A failure to break above $433 will most likely result in another plunge towards the big pivot area between $405-$406. This price level was respected on multiple occasions last month, so it is of great technical significance. And sell-off will most likely stall near this range.

Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator that helps investors identify price trends, measure trend momentum, and identify entry points for buying or selling a security. Gerald Appel developed the MACD indicator in the 1970s, and it is still one of the most popular technical tools today. It is readily available on most trading platforms offered by top online stock brokers.
The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The calculation creates the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called the signal line, plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals.
Traders may buy the security when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and sell—or short—the security when the MACD line crosses below the signal line. MACD indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.
MACD
=
12-Period EMA 
−
 26-Period EMA


\text{MACD}=\text{12-Period EMA }-\text{ 26-Period EMA}


MACD=12-Period EMA − 26-Period EMA
MACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (26 periods) from the short-term EMA (12 periods). An EMA is a moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.
The exponential moving average is an exponentially weighted moving average. An exponentially weighted moving average tends to have more significant reactions to recent price changes than a simple moving average (SMA).
MACD has a positive value (shown as the blue line on the MACD chart) whenever the 12-period EMA (indicated by the red line on the price chart) is above the 26-period EMA (the blue line in the price chart), and a negative value when the 12-period EMA is below the 26-period EMA. The distance between MACD and its baseline depends on the distance between the two EMAs.
As shown in the chart below, rises and drops in MACD (blue) values correspond to the movements of the two EMA lines.
MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the next chart below) that graphs the distance between MACD and its signal line. If MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline or zero line. If MACD is below its signal line, the histogram will be below the MACD’s baseline. Traders use the MACD’s histogram to identify peaks of bullish or bearish momentum, and to generate overbought/oversold trade signals.
The relative strength index (RSI) signals whether an instrument is overbought or oversold based on its recent price action. The RSI is an oscillator that calculates the average price gains and losses over a given period. The default is 14 periods with values bounded from 0 to 100. A reading above 70 suggests an overbought condition, while a reading below 30 is considered oversold, with both potentially signaling that a top or a bottom is forming.
Unlike the RSI or other oscillator studies, the MACD lines do n... [TRUNCADO]

There's a widespread belief in the cyclical nature of the crypto market. According to this concept, cryptoasset dynamics often follow a recognizable pattern: Bitcoin leads, then Ethereum gains attention, and finally altcoins rise. During these periods, many high-return opportunities emerge, leaving newcomers feeling they’ve missed out.
A trader's main challenge is identifying the period of the most active altcoin growth, commonly known as altseason. However, each cycle unfolds differently and is influenced by unique market events, complicating forecasting and analysis.
Coinpaper's editorial team explored what drives altcoin growth, which metrics indicate the approach of altseason, and how to use market data for informed decisions.
Altcoins are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. This category includes widely known assets like Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL), as well as smaller projects such as Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Aave (AAVE). Analysts classify altcoins based on their use cases or functionality, though no universally accepted standard exists.
The primary difference between Bitcoin and altcoins lies in market positioning and price behavior. Bitcoin, due to its high market capitalization, is considered a "base" asset or digital gold, while altcoins tend to be more volatile and are influenced by trends, speculation, and overall market sentiment.
Based on these distinctions, the crypto community has observed a sequence of capital flow through four phases:
Although technically altseason begins in the second phase, the community typically associates it with the fourth, when a broad range of assets outperforms Bitcoin and Ethereum. This period is characterized by growing retail interest, heightened media activity, new project launches, and expanding market capitalization of lesser-known tokens.
While the concept of cyclical capital flows underpins altseason theory, some analysts question its reliability. Arthur Hayes, for example, argues that four-year cycles no longer hold, while Bernstein suggests a possible extension of the bullish phase.
Other factors, such as institutional activity and macroeconomic conditions, are also reshaping traditional market dynamics. With over 100,000 altcoins and 400+ asset categories tracked by CoinGecko, establishing a unified classification system remains challenging.
The Altseason Index tracks how many of the top 50 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. If over 75% of these assets grow faster than Bitcoin, the market is considered to be in altseason.
As of September 2025, the index stands at 76 points, signaling broad altcoin outperformance. CoinGlass and CoinMarketCap offer similar versions, with minor differences due to calculation methods.
Historical charts of the Altseason Index reveal how capital flows between Bitcoin and altcoins over time. In September 2025, the index reached 80 points, marking the altseason zone. The gradual rise in 2025 contrasts with the sharp, short-lived ... [TRUNCADO]

Decoding Altcoin Season: Key Indicators and Timing Your Entry and Exit Points
Altcoin Season—a period characterized by high volatility and astronomical returns where cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (BTC) dramatically outperform the market leader—is the most anticipated event in the crypto world. Successfully Decoding Altcoin Season: Key Indicators and Timing Your Entry and Exit Points is crucial for maximizing profit while minimizing exposure to the inevitable sharp retracements. This intense phase, often lasting several weeks to a few months, is not a random event but a predictable cycle driven by capital flow, market psychology, and measurable quantitative metrics. Understanding the rhythm of this cycle is essential for any serious investor looking to capitalize on the next major wave, as detailed further in our comprehensive guide, Navigating the Altcoin Market: Investment Strategies, Altcoin Season Cycles, and Top Crypto Picks for 2025.
Altcoin Season is not a switch that flips overnight; it is the culmination of a multi-stage process that typically follows Bitcoin’s strong rally phase. Capital generally flows through the crypto ecosystem in a predictable manner:
Successful timing relies on analyzing specific, quantifiable metrics that track capital flow and market health. These indicators act as leading signals for entry and exit.
Bitcoin Dominance is arguably the single most critical metric. It represents the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization to the total cryptocurrency market capitalization.
The Total Altcoin Market Cap (often charted as TOTAL2, which excludes BTC) provides a clearer picture of the sheer volume of capital flowing into the alternative sector.
The true measure of Altcoin Season is the performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin.
Timing the exact start of Altcoin Season is impossible, but strategic investors position themselves during the optimal accumulation window—the period of low conviction and high fear preceding the dominance shift.
Rather than trying to catch the first green candle, employ a staged accumulation strategy:
Sector Rotation Insight: Entry timing can be further refined by watching sector rotation. Early Alt Seasons often favor foundational layers (L1s, scaling solutions, infrastructure). As the season matures, capital flows into riskier, narrative-driven sectors like meme coins, Gaming/Metaverse, or new AI applications (The Rise of AI and DeFi Altcoins: Sector-Specific Investment Opportunities and Risks).
The failure to execute a disciplined exit strategy is the number one reason investors lose profits during the volatile Altcoin Season. The peak is marked by extreme euphoria and irrational price action.
The final stage requires investors to ignore FOMO and focus purely on exit signals:
Instead of selling everything at one target, use a staggered, quantitative approach:
This strategy ensures you capture profits along the way and prevents the entire portfolio from collapsing during the inevitable ... [TRUNCADO]
